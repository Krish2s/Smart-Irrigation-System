# Smart-Irrigation-System
IOT based System using various Analog Sensors for smart Irrigation

Smart low-cost irrigation system using Arduino UNO, YL-69 soil moisture sensor, submersible dc water pump, HC-05 bluetooth module(additional)

# Abstract
The project describes smart irrigation system using the concepts of Internet of Things. The system consists of an arduino which is the microcontroller and controls a 5V semi- submersible water pump according to the water level in the soil. The system also consist a bluetooth module that can be used to connect the userâ€™s mobile application to the system. The user can receive sensor data values over the bluetooth using mobile application. The system automatically turns the water pump on when the moisture level in the soil is very low and turns the water pump off when the moisture level reaches the threshold value.

# Area of utility
The primary focus of this project is to help the farmers and reduce their work.

This project can be implemented in perennial plant irrigation land and gardening land.
